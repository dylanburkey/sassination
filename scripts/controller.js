			'content': 'Laser welding can help you make narrow and deep welds at high welding speeds and is often used in welding for high volume applications or in applications where low heat is important. In some cases, you may be able to make a weld that was not possible because of limitations with metal inert gas (MIG) process and tungsten inert gas (TIG) process. If you need high speed and a controlled heat input for meticulous detail, then a laser welding solution is for you.',

			'name': 'PRE AND POST HYDROFORMING AND STRUCTURAL FRAME AUTOMATION SYSTEMS',
			'image': 'http://automation.lincolnelectric.com/_img/hydroform-technology.png',
			'content': 'Hydroforming is a cost-effective way to shape metal into strong and lightweight components. This specialized die forming uses high pressure hydraulic fluid to press working material into the die. The use of tubular hydroformed components in automotive applications worldwide is increasing with each new model launch. Frames, structural members and suspension components made using the hydroform process provide greater rigidity and strength compared to their traditionally welded counterparts. Component shapes can be optimized for form or function. Reinforcing components or additional bracket elements can often be eliminated, allowing for simplified assembly, better fit up and higher quality in the finished vehicle.Hydroform technology provides automotive engineers with exceptional flexibility when considering designs and performance requirements for future vehicles. However, this flexibility is only viable when the manufacturing process that supports it can be performed effectively and economically. Automation solutions from Lincoln Electric are helping today’s manufacturers attain their performance goals.'

			'content': 'TOOLING Reliable, high-quality tooling is the key to success in a welding system. All of our tooling includes protective weld covers for all sensor cables, shielding from weld spatter and copper pneumatic air lines. We manufacture the highest quality specialized clamping devices in the industry, including toggle clamps, tube clamps, wire clamps and retract devices. These clamps are designed for reliability and durability, even when meeting the demands of harsh welding environments. Cylinders are designed in “closed” positions wherever possible to prevent damage to guide rods and seals. Specialized materials and coatings are often used on part locator blocks to prevent spatter buildup from causing quality problems.FIXTURING While robotic welding can vastly improve productivity over semiautomatic welding, the level of efficiency of automation depends upon the thoughtful design of the fixturing for maximum productivity. Robotic welding is economical when properly applied, but it can be terribly inefficient and cost-prohibitive when simple fixture design considerations are overlooked. Many productivity gains are realized, or lost, at the design stage and while parts fixturing performs a role that is simple, good fixture design is critical to the success of a robotic welding system.'
